## Why Snuze?

Nearly 70 million Americans suffer from a sleep disorder. Lack of sleep affects our heart health, our emotional health, and of course, our energy levels. We aimed to create a space where users can track their sleep habits, find tools to help fall asleep, and connect with others who may also be suffering from lack of sleep or poor sleep quality.

Snuze is a tranquil React app, and was designed to meet the needs of users who want some extra help to fall asleep comfortably. Snuze users benefit from free access to relaxing audio, nightly sleep quality tracking, data-based resource recommendations, an online community of other Snuzers, speech-based journaling and site navigation, and so much more. Don't sleep on Snuze - visit us tonight!
